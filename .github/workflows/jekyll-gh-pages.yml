    # Used to pull Go distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.

    # Used to specify whether caching is needed. Set to true, if you'd like to enable caching.
    cache: # optional, default is true
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file - go.sum
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
    # Target architecture for Go to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
