## Changelog

### Enhancements
*Things you added that don't break anything.  Regression tests for Bug Fixes count as Enhancements.*

### Bug Fixes
*Things you changed that fix bugs.  If a fixes a bug, but in so doing adds a new requirement, removes code, or requires a database reset and reindex, the breaking part of the change should be added to Incompatible Changes below also.*

### Incompatible Changes
*Things you broke while doing Enhancements and Bug Fixes.  Breaking changes include (1) adding new requirements and (2) removing code.  Renaming counts as (2) because a rename is a removal followed by an add.*

## Upgrading

*If you have any Incompatible Changes in the above Changelog, outline how users of prior versions can upgrade once this PR lands or when reviewers are testing locally.  A common upgrading step is "Database reset and re-index required".*
