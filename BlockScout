BlockScout
Blockchain Explorer for inspecting and analyzing EVM Chains.

Blockscout 

BlockScout provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes the POA Network, Gnosis Chain, Ethereum Classic and other Ethereum testnets, private networks and sidechains.

See our project documentation for detailed information and setup instructions.

For questions, comments and feature requests see the discussions section.

About BlockScout
BlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable. As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.

Supported Projects
BlockScout supports a number of projects. Hosted instances include POA Network, Gnosis Chain, Ethereum Classic, Sokol & Kovan testnets, and other EVM chains.
