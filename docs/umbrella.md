## Umbrella Project Organization

BlockScout is an Elixir [umbrella project](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/dependencies-and-umbrella-projects.html). Each directory under `apps/` is a separate [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) project and [OTP application](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html), but the projects can use each other as a dependency in their `mix.exs`.

Each OTP application has a restricted domain.

| Directory               | OTP Application     | Namespace         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `apps/ethereum_jsonrpc` | `:ethereum_jsonrpc` | `EthereumJSONRPC` | Ethereum JSONRPC client.  It is allowed to know `Explorer`'s param format, but it cannot directly depend on `:explorer`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `apps/explorer`         | `:explorer`         | `Explorer`        | Storage for the indexed chain.  Can read and write to the backing storage.  MUST be able to boot in a read-only mode when run independently from `:indexer`, so cannot depend on `:indexer` as that would start `:indexer` indexing.                                                                                                                                            |
| `apps/block_scout_web`     | `:block_scout_web`     | `BlockScoutWeb`     | Phoenix interface to `:explorer`.  The minimum interface to allow web access should go in `:block_scout_web`.  Any business rules or interface not tied directly to `Phoenix` or `Plug` should go in `:explorer`. MUST be able to boot in a read-only mode when run independently from `:indexer`, so cannot depend on `:indexer` as that would start `:indexer` indexing. |
| `apps/indexer`          | `:indexer`          | `Indexer`         | Uses `:ethereum_jsonrpc` to index chain and batch import data into `:explorer`.  Any process, `Task`, or `GenServer` that automatically reads from the chain and writes to `:explorer` should be in `:indexer`. This restricts automatic writes to `:indexer` and read-only mode can be achieved by not running `:indexer`.                                             |
