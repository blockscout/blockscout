# Docker-compose configuration

Runs Blockscout locally in Docker containers with [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

## Prerequisites

- Docker v20.10+
- Docker-compose 2.x.x+
- Running Ethereum JSON RPC client

## Building Docker containers from source

**Note**: in all below examples, you can use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`, if compose v2 plugin is installed in Docker.

```bash
cd ./docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
```

**Note**: if you don't need to make backend customizations, you can run `docker-compose up` in order to launch from pre-build backend Docker image. This will be much faster.

This command uses `docker-compose.yml` by-default, which builds the backend of the explorer into the Docker image and runs 9 Docker containers:

- Postgres 14.x database, which will be available at port 7432 on the host machine.
- Redis database of the latest version.
- Blockscout backend with api at /api path.
- Nginx proxy to bind backend, frontend and microservices.
- Blockscout explorer at http://localhost.

and 5 containers for microservices (written in Rust):

- [Stats](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout-rs/tree/main/stats) service with a separate Postgres 14 DB.
- [Sol2UML visualizer](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout-rs/tree/main/visualizer) service.
- [Sig-provider](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout-rs/tree/main/sig-provider) service.
- [User-ops-indexer](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout-rs/tree/main/user-ops-indexer) service.

**Note for Linux users**: Linux users need to run the local node on http://0.0.0.0/ rather than http://127.0.0.1/

## Run with docker-compose

- Running explorer: `docker-compose up -d`

All of the configs assume the is running at http://localhost.

In order to stop launched containers, run `docker-compose down`

You can adjust BlockScout environment variables:

- for backend in `./envs/common-blockscout.env`
- for frontend in `./envs/common-frontend.env`
- for stats service in `./envs/common-stats.env`
- for visualizer in `./envs/common-visualizer.env`
- for user-ops-indexer in `./envs/common-user-ops-indexer.env`
