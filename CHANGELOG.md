We faced method handler crashed error in Kotti
```
[%{code: -32000, data: %{block_number: 1743966, transaction_hash: "0x0e439d91608cfcd2ff89ca9345bb8a93a4f1522fe82a0666e21f02afa7011848", transaction_index: 0}, message: "method handler crashed"}]

I found similar issues but there is no solution yet
https://github.com/poanetwork/blockscout/issues/3234
https://github.com/poanetwork/blockscout/issues/2445

But I found that in our case in Kotti this transactions is contact creation tx. But tx doesn't has input (so no contract code).

- Fix scheduling of latest block polling in Realtime Fetcher

Timer is set using Elixir's `Process.send_after/3` method, which is incompatible with Erlang's `:timer` module.
Thus, `:timer.cancel` doesn't have any effect on it, and in fact returns `{:error, :badarg}`.
This causes more and more polling being scheduled after every websocket event, which might cause excessive flooding of a node with `eth_getBlockByNumber` requests after some running time.

- Fix tests of transactions on non-consensus blocks

Tests for BlockTransactionController mistakenly simulated transactions
on non-consensus blocks by making the `transaction.block` `consensus`
`false`, but this is unrealistic - the importing only sets the consensus
block to `transaction.block` and non-consensus blocks show up as
`transaction.transaction_forks` `transaction_fork.uncle`.  To prevent
this from happening again, `Explorer.Factory.with_block` now checks the
`block` has `consensus: true`.  With this setup fixed, the tests needed
to be updated to show that *no* _transactions_ would be shown for
non-consensus blocks (because there are only transactions forks) and
whether the non-consensus blocks showed as "above tip" only had to do
with the number being above the consensus number and not to do with it
being non-consensus.

Floki selectors are used to improve error messages when messages are
unexpected.

- Variable quantity is unused
- Fixes for ganache JSON RPC mistakes

- Fix test to expose #1277

expected value for better error message from `assert`.

- Fix 'DBConnection.OwnershipError' in feature tests.

* Add sandbox config to shared mode when test is async false.

- Fix frontend tests

- Update spandex for run time config
- Fix missed pinning

- Fix picking wrong clause for fetch_token_balances_from_blockchain

Fixes #1215

The short-circuiting `[]` was not being used.

- Fix Address Trasaction query

* When we removed the Transaction dynamic query in favor of a union approach, we removed the guarantee we had with the joins and the subquery.

* The bug was that only the first transaction that had token transfers was being shown.

- Fix realtime indexer's 'no skips prevention' bug

Why:

* For the realtime indexer's logic that fills in skipped block numbers
to account for reorgs. See issue for details and examples.
* Issue link: https://github.com/poanetwork/blockscout/issues/1189

This change addresses the need by:

* Editing the realtime fetcher to keep track of the max block number
seen.
* Editing realtime fetcher's `start_fetch_and_import` function to only
fill in for skipped block numbers when the block number received from
the `newHeads` subscription is not a reorg. A reorg in this case is
defined as a block number that is less than or equal to the max block
number the realtime fetcher has seen.
* Editing realtime fetcher's `fetch_and_import_block` function to wait 5
seconds if the block number given for it to fetch is a reorg. This is
useful to improve the chance that the latest fetched block for a given
number gets consensus. E.g. when goerli's `newHeads` sends two identical
block numbers at virtually the same time: `100, 101, 101, 102, 103`, we
want to increase the chance taht the second attempt at fetching 101 gets
consensus.

- Fix displayed address length

- Fix blocks validated page to show all tabs

* Add to blocks validated use the "address/_tabs.html" partial
* Add to "address/_tabs.html" considers if block validated page is the current page
* Add tests to ensure all behavior above.

- Fix realtime address balance update

The balance update stopped working because the client was trying to
subscribe twice in the channel topic. When the server receives a
duplicated subscription, he closes the first connection to open a new
one.

In our case, the client subscribed in the address channel in address.js
and again address/transactions.js, then the server was keeping only the
last subscription.

- Fix the tests

- Fix test

- Fix randomly failing test

- Match more explicitly on ABI decoding result
- Fix controller tests


### üöú Refactor

- Refactor transaction tile identifier

Now both transactions and emission rewards must be in the same list, so
I changed the identifier to a more generic name to contemplate both of
cases.

- Refactor transactions page

As we did in other pages, we removed the infinite scroll and make the
first load async.

- Refactor address.js to use async_load_listing redux


### üìö Documentation

- Document Explorer.Chain.SmartContract

Fixes #1342

Document `t:Explorer.Chain.SmartContract.t/0` to clarify difference
between `t:Explorer.Chain.SmartContract.t/0` `contract_source_code` and
`t:Explorer.Chain.Address.t/0` `contract_code`.

Include Solidity ABI Spec docs so domain knowledge is available with the
source.


## [1.2.1-beta] - 2018-12-03

### üöÄ Features

- Support tracing via spandex

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix pagination on inventory tab at Token's page

This code was removed and it shouldn't :(. Besides bringing this code
back, I'm adding tests in the controller layer to make sure that it will
not happen anymore.

- Fix pages broken by previous commit

- Fix token transfers' tests

- Fix core tests

- Fix typo in "validation count" redux when loading state.

- Fix the tests

this test was breaking because it started from the async page that was
very unstable and the element wasn't being found by the driver even
though it works correctly on a normal browser so I made it change the
starting point to a page that is no async and skipping the "click on the
tab step"


### üöú Refactor

- Refactor JS for async load

- Refactor controller and template for async load

- Refactor async listing load to use redux

- Refactor template for first page async load

- Refactor token transfers' pagination

We changed the token transfer's pagination uses the block_number instead
of the inserted_at. It will make the pagination consistent since the
list is sorted by the block_number.


## [1.2.0-beta] - 2018-11-21

### üöÄ Features

- Fix ABI decodding, and decode tx logs
- Decode transaction input on overview

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix pattern matching error when transaction does not loads to_address.smart_contract

- Fix project timeline link on README

- Fix heading
- Fix loading of secrets file for test

- Fix performance issue in address page

- Fix layout test

- Fix no schema on GraphiQL

Why:

* For the schema to be available at `/graphiql`
* Issue link: https://github.com/poanetwork/blockscout/issues/1042

This change addresses the need by:

* Changing GraphQL `max_complexity` from 50 to 200 for introspection to
be possible on GraphiQL.
* Editing test that relied on a `max_complexity` of 50.

### üöú Refactor

- Refactor metadata_updater to get interval on start

- Refactor cataloged token query to Chain.Token

- Refactor Indexer.Token.Fetcher

This refactor aims to remove the responsability of reading functions
from the Smart Contract from Token.Fetcher. Now, we have the module
Explorer.Token.FunctionsReader that is responsible for it.

- Refactor message building from controller to view


### ‚ö° Performance

- Performance improvements to generation of top accounts page

The list_top_addresses query is now a left join of addresses and transactions tables,
returning the top 250 address and their respective transaction counts at the same time.

The call to transaction_count() which hits the database has been removed from the per account tile template,
and the value is now passed in from the above query.

balance_percentage/2() has been added, taking total_supply as an argument rather than querying the database.
The per account tile template now uses this version, with total_supply queried once and passed in.

It may be worth adding an index to the addresses table i.e.
create index addresses_fetched_coin_balance_hash_index on addresses (fetched_coin_balance desc nulls last, hash asc);

Note the list_top_address query makes use of a SQL fragment as the version of Ecto used by blockscout does not support coalesce.

## [1.1.0-beta] - 2018-10-26

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Sleep when throttled to prevent stampedes
- Fix error when indexing Wanchain

Why:

* When attempting to index Wanchain we were seeing this error:
  ```
  ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in
  EthereumJSONRPC.Transaction.entry_to_elixir/1
  (ethereum_jsonrpc) lib/ethereum_jsonrpc/transaction.ex:260:
  EthereumJSONRPC.Transaction.entry_to_elixir({"txType", "0x1"})
  ```

  After looking into this it looks like Wanchain returns a "txType" of 1
  for normal transactions and 6 for privacy transactions. It's not clear
  at this time if this is something we want BlockScout to keep track of so
  we'll be ignoring it for now.
* Issue link: https://github.com/poanetwork/blockscout/issues/994

This change addresses the need by:

* Editing `EthereumJSONRPC.Transaction.entry_to_elixir/1` to accept a
key of "txType" without generating a `FunctionClauseError`.

### üöú Refactor

- Refactor link to allow for updatable counter
- Refactor transactions count by address

Now, the app is going to count how many transactions an specific address
has sent instead of an estimated count.

The reasons why we are doing that are:
- we have a inaccurate count (bad user experience)
- it's slower

As we already store the nonce when the app index transactions, we can
query this value by address to know how many transactions the address
has sent.

- Fix token holders' tab at the Token's page

This page was breaking when the given Token has the total supply nil.

To fix that, we added a view function to check if we should show the
total supply percentage. Since we want to display just for Tokens that
have total supply, we are ignoring for the ones that don't have.

I'm changing to use `@token.contract_address_hash` for it doesn't depend
from URL params anymore.

- Fix div overflow in Smart Contract's page.

- Fix tab-menu active style in Read Contract's page

We displayed the Read Contract's tab and Token Holder's tab as active
style instead of just the first one.

- Fix bullets
- Fix bullet points

- Fix explorer test

- Fix small mistake of addin mr-4 to a data attribute

- Fix token balances' query

This query was considering the next-to-last token balance when the last
one had the value 0.

In order to this work properly, I'm moving the query that gets token
balances from the last block to a sub-query and moving the condition to
consider just values greater than 0 to the main query.  This way we are
sure that we always are considering the last block and we are skipping
the ones that have the value equal to 0.

    ** (EXIT) an exception was raised:
        ** (ArgumentError) :json_rpc_named_arguments must be provided to
          `Elixir.Indexer.InternalTransactionFetcher.child_spec to allow for json_rpc calls when running.
```

It was missing the `json_rpc_named_arguments` to InternalTransactionFetcher children.

### üöú Refactor

- Refactor block tile partial and fix import transition on homepage

- Refactor to replace any block that matches the new block received

- Refactor view to use configured envs

Since we have different networks, this commit allows us to use the
information below from the environmnet:

* network title
* subnetwork title
* network icon
* network logo

If those configurations are not set in the env, we are going to use the
default from POA.

- Refactor Token's page controller

We are refactoring this controller to follow the same pattern that we
have been using in the Address's page and Transaction's page since it
uses the same approach.

This way, we can use a generic helper to deal with tabs.

- Refactor address rendering functions and add test coverage
- Refactor button class names

- Refactor block and transaction details overview layout to align cards

- Refactor Token Balances dropdown to use database

- Refactor 'Read Smart Contract' functionality to be via AJAX

- Refactor 'tokens' to be inside a namespace

* Moved token related files under 'tokens' namespace;
* Created 'tokens/overview/details' partial with the tokens header information;
* Add 'tokens/read_contract_controller.ex';

- Refactor import test
- Refactor identical transaction tiles to single partial
