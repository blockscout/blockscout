# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we — as contributors and maintainers — pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully  
- Focusing on what benefits the community as a whole  
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission  
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable standards of behavior and are expected to take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any violations.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Maintainers may also ban contributors temporarily or permanently for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via official social media accounts, or representing the project at online or offline events. Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation as needed.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **andrew@poa.network**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and appropriate action will be taken as necessary.  
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other project leaders.
