 * @title HomeWork Interface (version 1) - EIP165 ID 0xe5399799
 * @author 0age
 * @notice Homework is a utility to find, share, and reuse "home" addresses for
 * contracts. Anyone can work to find a new home address by searching for keys,
 * a 32-byte value with the first 20 bytes equal to the finder's calling address
 * (or derived by hashing an arbitrary 32-byte salt and the caller's address),
 * and can then deploy any contract they like (even one with a constructor) to
 * the address, or mint an ERC721 token that the owner can redeem that will then
 * allow them to do the same. Also, if the contract is `SELFDESTRUCT`ed, a new
 * contract can be redeployed by the current controller to the same address!
 * @dev This contract allows contract addresses to be located ahead of time, and
 * for arbitrary bytecode to be deployed (and redeployed if so desired, i.e.
 * metamorphic contracts) to the located address by a designated controller. To
 * enable this, the contract first deploys an "initialization-code-in-runtime"
 * contract, with the creation code of the contract you want to deploy stored in
 * RUNTIME code. Then, to deploy the actual contract, it retrieves the address
 * of the storage contract and `DELEGATECALL`s into it to execute the init code
 * and, if successful, retrieves and returns the contract runtime code. Rather
 * than using a located address directly, you can also lock it in the contract
 * and mint and ERC721 token for it, which can then be redeemed in order to gain
 * control over deployment to the address (note that tokens may not be minted if
 * the contract they control currently has a deployed contract at that address).
 * Once a contract undergoes metamorphosis, all existing storage will be deleted
 * and any existing contract code will be replaced with the deployed contract
 * code of the new implementation contract. The mechanisms behind this contract
 * are highly experimental - proceed with caution and please share any exploits
 * or optimizations you discover.

/**
 * @title HomeWork (version 1)
 * @author 0age
 * @notice Homework is a utility to find, share, and reuse "home" addresses for
 * contracts. Anyone can work to find a new home address by searching for keys,
 * a 32-byte value with the first 20 bytes equal to the finder's calling address
 * (or derived by hashing an arbitrary 32-byte salt and the caller's address),
 * and can then deploy any contract they like (even one with a constructor) to
 * the address, or mint an ERC721 token that the owner can redeem that will then
 * allow them to do the same. Also, if the contract is `SELFDESTRUCT`ed, a new
 * contract can be redeployed by the current controller to the same address!
 * @dev This contract allows contract addresses to be located ahead of time, and
 * for arbitrary bytecode to be deployed (and redeployed if so desired, i.e.
 * metamorphic contracts) to the located address by a designated controller. To
 * enable this, the contract first deploys an "initialization-code-in-runtime"
 * contract, with the creation code of the contract you want to deploy stored in
 * RUNTIME code. Then, to deploy the actual contract, it retrieves the address
 * of the storage contract and `DELEGATECALL`s into it to execute the init code
 * and, if successful, retrieves and returns the contract runtime code. Rather
 * than using a located address directly, you can also lock it in the contract
 * and mint and ERC721 token for it, which can then be redeemed in order to gain
 * control over deployment to the address (note that tokens may not be minted if
 * the contract they control currently has a deployed contract at that address).
 * Once a contract undergoes metamorphosis, all existing storage will be deleted
 * and any existing contract code will be replaced with the deployed contract
 * code of the new implementation contract. The mechanisms behind this contract
 * are highly experimental - proceed with caution and please share any exploits
 * or optimizations you discover.
