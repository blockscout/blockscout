  A [second-degree relative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-degree_relative) is a relative where the share
  point is the parent's parent block in the chain.

  For Ethereum, nephews are rewarded for included their uncles.

  Uncles occur when a Proof-of-Work proof is completed slightly late, but before the next block is completes, so the
  network knows about the late proof and can credit as an uncle in the next block.

  This schema is the join schema between the `nephew` and the `uncle` it is is including the `uncle`.  The actual
  `uncle` block is still a normal `t:Explorer.Chain.Block.t/0`.
