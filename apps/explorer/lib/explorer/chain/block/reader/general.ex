    Converts a timestamp to its nearest block number.

    Locates the block number closest to a given timestamp, with options to adjust the
    search to find blocks either before or after the timestamp, and to handle null
    rounds in the blockchain.

    ## Parameters
    - `given_timestamp`: The timestamp for which the closest block number is
      being sought.
    - `closest`: A direction indicator (`:before` or `:after`) specifying
                whether the block number returned should be before or after the
                given timestamp.
    - `from_api`: A boolean flag indicating whether to use the replica database
                  or the primary one for the query.
    - `strict`: A boolean flag controlling the block selection behavior:
      * `false` (default): Returns the block with smallest absolute time
        difference, then adjusts based on `closest` parameter if needed. In this
        mode, the function could return a block number which does not exist
        in the database.
      * `true`: Returns strictly the first existing block before/after the
        timestamp based on the `closest` parameter.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, block_number}` where `block_number` is the block number closest to
      the specified timestamp.
    - `{:error, :not_found}` if no block is found within the specified criteria
      or if the found block represents a null round.
