defmodule Explorer.Chain.Celo.ElectionReward do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the rewards distributed in an epoch election. Each reward has a
  type, and each type of reward is paid in a specific token. The rewards are
  paid to an account address and are also associated with another account
  address.

  ## Reward Types and Addresses

  Here is the breakdown of what each address means for each type of reward:

  - `voter`:
    - Account address: The voter address.
    - Associated account address: The group address.
  - `validator`:
    - Account address: The validator address.
    - Associated account address: The validator group address.
  - `group`:
    - Account address: The validator group address.
    - Associated account address: The validator address that the reward was paid
      on behalf of.
  - `delegated_payment`:
    - Account address: The beneficiary receiving the part of the reward on
      behalf of the validator.
    - Associated account address: The validator that set the delegation of a
      part of their reward to some external address.
