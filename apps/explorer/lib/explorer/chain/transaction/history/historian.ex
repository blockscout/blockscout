    Compiles transaction statistics for a specified number of days.

    This function recursively collects daily transaction statistics, starting
    from the earliest date in the range and moving forward towards the current
    date. The current day's stats are set to zero to avoid presenting incomplete
    data.

    The function attempts to find the appropriate block range for each day and
    compile statistics. If block range determination fails, it employs a fallback
    method or sets the day's stats to zero.

    ## Parameters
    - `num_days`: The number of days to compile records for.
    - `records`: An accumulator for the compiled records. Defaults to an empty list.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, [dated_record()]}`: A list of daily transaction statistics on success.
    - `:error`: If an unrecoverable error occurs during compilation.
