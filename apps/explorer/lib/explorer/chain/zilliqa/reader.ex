  @doc """
  Returns a stream of `t:Explorer.Chain.Address.t/0` for Scilla smart contracts
  that should be displayed as verified. The stream yields unverified addresses
  with fetched contract code created by transactions with `v` = `0`.

  ## Parameters

    - `initial`: The initial accumulator value for the stream.
    - `reducer`: A function that processes each entry in the stream, receiving
      the entry and the current accumulator, and returning a new accumulator.
    - `limited?`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the result set should be
      limited. Defaults to `false`.

  ## Returns

    - `{:ok, accumulator}`: The final accumulator value after streaming through
      the unverified Scilla smart contract addresses.
