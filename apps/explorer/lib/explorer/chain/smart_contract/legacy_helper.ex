  @moduledoc """
  Legacy functions for SmartContract verification during database migration.

  This module contains legacy query functions that are used as a fallback during
  the migration period when the `language` field is being populated in the
  smart_contracts table. These functions maintain compatibility with
  pre-migration behavior by checking both the new `language` field and the
  legacy boolean flags like `is_vyper_contract`.

  All functions in this module are temporary and will be removed after the
  following migrations are complete:
  - smart_contract_language background migration
  - sanitize_verified_addresses background migration
  - heavy_indexes_create_smart_contracts_language_index migration
