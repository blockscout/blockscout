defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.MessagesToL2Matcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Matches and processes L1-to-L2 messages in the Arbitrum protocol.

  This module implements a buffered task system to handle the matching of
  L1-to-L2 messages with hashed message IDs. It periodically attempts to match
  unmatched messages, imports matched messages to the database, and reschedules
  unmatched messages for future processing.

  The matcher operates asynchronously, allowing for efficient handling of
  messages even when corresponding L1 transactions are not yet indexed. This
  approach prevents blocking the discovery process and ensures eventual
  consistency in message matching.

  Key features:
  - Implements the `BufferedTask` behavior for efficient batch processing.
  - Maintains a cache of uncompleted message IDs to optimize matching.
  - Provides functionality to asynchronously schedule message matching.
  - Automatically retries unmatched messages based on a configurable interval.

    Defines the child specification for the MessagesToL2Matcher.

    This function creates a child specification for use in a supervision tree,
    configuring a `BufferedTask` process for the MessagesToL2Matcher. It sets up
    the initial state and options for the task, including the recheck interval
    for matching L1-to-L2 messages.

    Using the same value for discovering new L1 messages interval and for the
    unmatched L2 messages recheck interval ensures that message matching attempts
    are synchronized with the rate of new L1 message discovery, optimizing the
    process by avoiding unnecessary rechecks when no new L1 messages have been
    added to the database.

    ## Parameters
    - `init_options`: A keyword list of initial options for the BufferedTask.
    - `gen_server_options`: A keyword list of options for the underlying GenServer.

    ## Returns
    A child specification map suitable for use in a supervision tree, with the
    following key properties:
    - Uses `BufferedTask` as the module to start.
    - Configures the MessagesToL2Matcher as the callback module for the BufferedTask.
    - Sets the initial state with an empty cache of IDs of uncompleted messages and
      the recheck interval from the Arbitrum.TrackingMessagesOnL1 configuration.
    - Merges provided options with default options for the BufferedTask.
    - Uses this module's name as the child's id in the supervision tree.

    Processes a batch of transactions with hashed message IDs for L1-to-L2 messages.

    This function, implementing the `BufferedTask` behavior, handles a list of
    transactions with associated timeouts. It attempts to match hashed request IDs
    with uncompleted L1-to-L2 messages, updates the transactions accordingly, and
    imports any successfully matched messages to the database.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Separates transactions with expired timeouts from those still delayed.
    2. Attempts to update expired transactions by matching their hashed request IDs.
    3. Processes updated transactions to filter and import L1-to-L2 messages.
    4. Reschedules unmatched or delayed transactions for future processing.

    For unmatched transactions, new timeouts are set to the current time increased
    by the value of the recheck interval.

    ## Parameters
    - `transactions_with_timeouts`: A list of tuples, each containing a timeout and a
      transaction with a potentially hashed request ID.
    - `state`: The current state of the task, including cached IDs of uncompleted
      messages and the recheck interval.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, updated_state}` if all transactions were processed successfully and
      no retries are needed.
    - `{:retry, transactions_to_retry, updated_state}` if some transactions need to be
      retried, either due to unmatched request IDs or unexpired timeouts.

    The returned state always includes an updated cache of IDs of uncompleted
    messages.
