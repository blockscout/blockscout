defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Workers.HistoricalMessagesOnL2 do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles the discovery and processing of historical messages between Layer 1 (L1)  and Layer 2 (L2) within an Arbitrum rollup.

  ## L1-to-L2 Messages
  L1-to-L2 messages are discovered by first inspecting the database to identify
  potentially missed messages. Then, rollup transactions are requested through RPC
  to fetch the necessary data. This is required because some Arbitrum-specific fields,
  such as the `requestId`, are not included in the already indexed transactions within
  the database.

  ## L2-to-L1 Messages
  L2-to-L1 messages are discovered by analyzing the logs of already indexed rollup
  transactions.

    Initiates the discovery process for historical messages sent from L2 to L1 up to a specified block number.

    This function orchestrates the discovery of historical messages from L2 to L1
    by analyzing the rollup logs representing the `L2ToL1Tx` event. It determines
    the starting block for the discovery process and verifies that the relevant
    rollup block range has been indexed before proceeding with the discovery and
    data import. During the import process, each message is assigned the
    appropriate status based on the current rollup state.

    ## Parameters
    - `end_block`: The ending block number up to which the discovery should occur.
      If `nil` or less than the indexer's first block, the function returns with no
      action taken.
    - `state`: Contains the operational configuration, including the depth of
      blocks to consider for the starting point of message discovery and the
      first block of the rollup chain.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, nil}`: If `end_block` is `nil`, indicating no discovery action was
      required.
    - `{:ok, rollup_first_block}`: If `end_block` is less than the indexer's first
      block, indicating that the "genesis" of the blockchain was reached.
    - `{:ok, start_block}`: Upon successful discovery of historical messages, where
      `start_block` indicates the necessity to consider another block range in the
      next iteration of message discovery.
    - `{:ok, end_block + 1}`: If the required block range is not fully indexed,
      indicating that the next iteration of message discovery should start with the
      same block range.

    Initiates the discovery of historical messages sent from L1 to L2 up to a specified block number.

    This function orchestrates the process of discovering historical L1-to-L2
    messages within a given rollup block range, based on the existence of the
    `requestId` field in the rollup transaction body. The initial list of
    transactions that could contain the messages is received from the database, and
    then their bodies are re-requested through RPC because already indexed
    transactions from the database cannot be utilized; the `requestId` field is not
    included in the transaction model. The function ensures that the block range
    has been indexed before proceeding with message discovery and import.

    Messages with plain (non-hashed) request IDs are imported into the database and
    marked as `:relayed`, representing completed actions from L1 to L2.

    For transactions where the `requestId` represents a hashed message ID, the
    function schedules asynchronous discovery to match them with corresponding L1
    transactions.

    ## Parameters
    - `end_block`: The ending block number for the discovery operation. If `nil` or
      less than the indexer's first block, the function returns with no action
      taken.
    - `state`: The current state of the operation, containing configuration
      parameters including the depth of blocks to consider for the starting point
      of message discovery, size of chunk to make request to RPC, and JSON RPC
      connection settings.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, nil}`: If `end_block` is `nil`, indicating no action was necessary.
    - `{:ok, rollup_first_block}`: If `end_block` is less than the indexer's first
      block, indicating that the "genesis" of the blockchain was reached.
    - `{:ok, start_block}`: On successful completion of historical message
      discovery, where `start_block` indicates the necessity to consider another
      block range in the next iteration of message discovery.
    - `{:ok, end_block + 1}`: If the required block range is not fully indexed,

  #
  # This function asynchronously handles transactions that contain L1-to-L2

  #
  # The asynchronous handling is beneficial because:
  # - If the corresponding L1 transaction is already indexed, the message will be
  #   imported after the next flush of the queued tasks buffer.
  # - If the corresponding L1 transaction is not yet indexed, it will be awaited by
  #   the queued tasks handler.
  #
  # Asynchronous processing prevents locking the discovery process, which would
  # occur if we waited synchronously for L1 transactions to be indexed. Another
  # approach for synchronous handling is to skip a message without importing it to
  # the DB when an L1 transaction is not found; the absence of the message will be
  # discovered after a Blockscout instance restart. In the current asynchronous
  # implementation, even if the awaiting of an L1 transaction in the queued tasks
  # is terminated due to a Blockscout instance shutdown, the absence of the message
  # will be discovered after the restart. The system will then attempt to match it
  # with the corresponding L1 message again.
