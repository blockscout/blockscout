defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Workers.HistoricalMessagesOnL2 do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles the discovery and processing of historical messages between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) within an Arbitrum rollup.

  L1-to-L2 messages are discovered by requesting rollup transactions through RPC.
  This is necessary because some Arbitrum-specific fields are not included in the
  already indexed transactions within the database.

  L2-to-L1 messages are discovered by analyzing the logs of already indexed rollup
  transactions.

    Initiates the discovery process for historical messages sent from L2 to L1 up to a specified block number.

    This function orchestrates the discovery of historical messages from L2 to L1
    by analyzing the rollup logs representing the `L2ToL1Tx` event. It determines
    the starting block for the discovery process and verifies that the relevant
    rollup block range has been indexed before proceeding with the discovery and
    data import. During the import process, each message is assigned the
    appropriate status based on the current rollup state.

    ## Parameters
    - `end_block`: The ending block number up to which the discovery should occur.
                   If `nil` or negative, the function returns with no action taken.
    - `state`: Contains the operational configuration, including the depth of
               blocks to consider for the starting point of message discovery.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, nil}`: If `end_block` is `nil`, indicating no discovery action was required.
    - `{:ok, 0}`: If `end_block` is negative, indicating that the genesis of the block
                  chain was reached.
    - `{:ok, start_block}`: Upon successful discovery of historical messages, where
                            `start_block` indicates the necessity to consider another
                            block range in the next iteration of message discovery.
    - `{:ok, end_block + 1}`: If the required block range is not fully indexed,
                              indicating that the next iteration of message discovery
                              should start with the same block range.

  @doc """
    Initiates the discovery of historical messages sent from L1 to L2 up to a specified block number.

    This function orchestrates the process of discovering historical L1-to-L2 messages within
    a given rollup block range, based on the existence of the `requestId` field in the rollup
    transaction body. Transactions are requested through RPC because already indexed
    transactions from the database cannot be utilized; the `requestId` field is not included
    in the transaction model. The function ensures that the block range has been indexed
    before proceeding with message discovery and import. The imported messages are marked as
    `:relayed`, as they represent completed actions from L1 to L2.

    ## Parameters
    - `end_block`: The ending block number for the discovery operation. If `nil` or negative,
      the function returns immediately with no action.
    - `state`: The current state of the operation, containing configuration parameters
      including `messages_to_l2_blocks_depth`, `chunk_size`, and JSON RPC connection settings.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, nil}`: If `end_block` is `nil`, indicating no action was necessary.
    - `{:ok, 0}`: If `end_block` is negative, indicating that the genesis of the block chain
                  was reached.
    - `{:ok, start_block}`: On successful completion of historical message discovery, where
                            `start_block` indicates the necessity to consider another block
                            range in the next iteration of message discovery.
    - `{:ok, end_block + 1}`: If the required block range is not fully indexed, indicating
                              that the next iteration of message discovery should start with
                              the same block range.
