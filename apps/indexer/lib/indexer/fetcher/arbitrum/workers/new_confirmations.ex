defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Workers.NewConfirmations do
  @moduledoc """
    Handles the discovery and processing of new and historical confirmations of rollup blocks for an Arbitrum rollup.

    This module orchestrates the discovery of rollup block confirmations delivered
    to the Arbitrum Outbox contract. It distinguishes between new confirmations of
    rollup blocks and past confirmations that were previously unprocessed or missed.

    The process involves fetching logs for the `SendRootUpdated` events emitted by
    the Arbitrum Outbox contract. These events indicate the top of the rollup blocks
    confirmed up to a specific point in time. The identified block is used to find
    all blocks beneath it that are not confirmed by other `SendRootUpdated` events.
    All discovered blocks are then linked with the corresponding transaction that
    emitted the `SendRootUpdated` event. Additionally, L2-to-L1 messages included in
    the rollup blocks up to the confirmed top are identified to change their status
    from `:sent` to `:confirmed`.

    Though the `SendRootUpdated` event implies that all rollup blocks below the
    mentioned block are confirmed, the current design of the process attempts to
    match every rollup block to a specific confirmation. This means that if there
    are two confirmations, and the earlier one points to block N while the later
    points to block M (such that M > N), the blocks from N+1 to M are linked with
    the latest confirmation, and blocks from X+1 to N are linked to the earlier
    confirmation (where X is the rollup block mentioned in an even earlier
    confirmation).

    Currently, the process of discovering confirmed rollup blocks works with any
    position of the top confirmed block in a batch. Later, if it is confirmed that
    the top block in a confirmation always aligns with the last block in a batch,
    this approach to rollup block discovery can be revisited for simplification.

    Discovers and processes new confirmations of rollup blocks within a calculated block range.

    This function identifies the appropriate L1 block range for discovering new
    rollup confirmations. It fetches logs representing `SendRootUpdated` events
    within this range to identify the new tops of rollup block confirmations. The
    discovered confirmations are processed to update the status of rollup blocks
    and L2-to-L1 messages accordingly. Eventually, updated rollup blocks,
    cross-chain messages, and newly constructed lifecycle transactions are imported
    into the database.

    ## Parameters
    - A map containing:
      - `config`: Configuration settings including the L1 outbox address, L1 RPC
                  configurations.
      - `data`: Contains the starting L1 block number from which to begin the new
                confirmation discovery.

    ## Returns
    - `{retcode, end_block}` where `retcode` is either `:ok` or
      `:confirmation_missed` indicating the success or failure of the discovery
      process, and `end_block` is used to determine the start block number for the
      next iteration of new confirmations discovery.
    - `{:ok, start_block - 1}` if there are no new blocks to be processed,
      indicating that the current start block should be reconsidered in the next
      iteration.

  # Discovers rollup blocks within a single confirmation, ensuring no gaps in the confirmed range.
  #
  # This function follows these steps to identify unconfirmed rollup blocks related
  # to a single confirmation event:
  # 1. Retrieve the batch associated with the specified rollup block number.
  # 2. Obtain a list of unconfirmed blocks within that batch.
  # 3. Determine the first unconfirmed block in the batch, considering potential
  #    gaps or already confirmed blocks.
  # 4. Verify the continuity of the unconfirmed blocks range to ensure there are no
  #    database inconsistencies or unindexed blocks.
  # 5. If the first unconfirmed block is at the start of the batch, check if the
  #    confirmation also covers blocks from previous batches. If so, include their
  #    unconfirmed blocks in the range.
  # 6. If all blocks in the previous batch are confirmed, return the current list of
  #    unconfirmed blocks.
  # 7. If the first unconfirmed block is in the middle of the batch, return the
  #    current list of unconfirmed blocks.
  # This process continues recursively until it finds a batch with all blocks
  # confirmed, encounters a gap, or reaches the start of the chain of blocks related
  # to the confirmation.
  #
  # Cache Behavior:
  # For each new confirmation, the cache for `eth_getLogs` requests starts empty.
  # During recursive calls for previous batches, the cache fills with results for
  # specific block ranges. With the confirmation description remaining constant
  # through these calls, the cache effectively reduces the number of requests by
  # reusing results for events related to previous batches within the same block
  # ranges. Although the same logs might be re-requested for other confirmations
  # within the same discovery iteration, the cache is not shared across different
  # confirmations and resets for each new confirmation. Extending cache usage
  # across different confirmations would require additional logic to match block
  # ranges and manage cache entries, significantly complicating cache handling.
  # Given the rarity of back-to-back confirmations in the same iteration of
  # discovery in a production environment, the added complexity of shared caching
  # is deemed excessive.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `rollup_block_num`: The rollup block number associated with the confirmation.
  # - `confirmation_desc`: Description of the latest confirmation.
  # - `outbox_config`: Configuration for the Arbitrum outbox contract.
  # - `cache`: A cache to minimize repetitive `eth_getLogs` calls.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - `{:ok, unconfirmed_blocks}`: A list of rollup blocks that are confirmed by
  #   the current confirmation but not yet marked as confirmed in the database.
  # - `{:error, []}`: If a discrepancy or inconsistency is found during the
  #   discovery process.

  # Finalizes lifecycle transaction descriptions and establishes database-ready links
  # between confirmed rollup blocks and their corresponding lifecycle transactions.
  #
  # This function executes chunked requests to L1 to retrieve block timestamps, which,
  # along with the finalization flag, are then used to finalize the lifecycle
  # transaction descriptions. Each entity in the list of blocks, which needs to be
  # confirmed, is updated with the associated lifecycle transaction IDs and prepared
  # for import.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `basic_lifecycle_txs`: The initial list of partially filled lifecycle transaction
  #                          descriptions.
  # - `confirmed_rollup_blocks`: Rollup blocks to be considered as confirmed.
  # - `l1_blocks_requests`: RPC requests of `eth_getBlockByNumber` to fetch L1 block data
  #                         for use in the lifecycle transaction descriptions.
  # - A map containing L1 RPC configuration such as JSON RPC arguments, chunk size,
  #   and a flag indicating whether to track the finalization of transactions.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - A tuple containing:
  #   - The list of lifecycle transactions, ready for import.
  #   - The list of confirmed rollup blocks, ready for import.
  #   - The highest confirmed block number processed during this run.
