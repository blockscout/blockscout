defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Workers.NewL1Executions do
  @moduledoc """
    Coordinates the discovery and processing of new and historical L2-to-L1 message executions for an Arbitrum rollup.

    This module is responsible for identifying and importing executions of messages
    that were initiated from Arbitrum's Layer 2 (L2) and are to be relayed to
    Layer 1 (L1). It handles both new executions that are currently occurring on L1
    and historical executions that occurred in the past but have not yet been
    processed.

    Discovery of these message executions involves parsing logs for
    `OutBoxTransactionExecuted` events emitted by the Arbitrum outbox contract. As
    the logs do not provide comprehensive data for constructing the related
    lifecycle transactions, the module executes batched RPC calls to
    `eth_getBlockByNumber`, using the responses to obtain transaction timestamps,
    thereby enriching the lifecycle transaction data.

    Discovers and processes new executions of L2-to-L1 messages within the current L1 block range.

                  logs.
      - `data`: Contains the starting block number for new execution discovery.

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, end_block}`: On successful discovery and processing, where `end_block`
