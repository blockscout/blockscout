defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Workers.Confirmations.Tasks do
  @moduledoc """
    Handles the discovery and processing of new and historical confirmations of rollup blocks for an Arbitrum rollup.

    This module orchestrates two distinct confirmation discovery processes:
    1. New confirmations discovery - processes recent confirmations from the
       chain head
    2. Historical confirmations discovery - handles previously missed or unprocessed
       confirmations

    The process involves fetching logs for the `SendRootUpdated` events emitted by
    the Arbitrum Outbox contract. These events indicate the top of the rollup blocks
    confirmed up to a specific point in time. The identified block is used to find
    all blocks beneath it that are not confirmed by other `SendRootUpdated` events.
    All discovered blocks are then linked with the corresponding transaction that
    emitted the `SendRootUpdated` event. Additionally, L2-to-L1 messages included in
    the rollup blocks up to the confirmed top are identified to change their status
    from `:sent` to `:confirmed`.

    Though the `SendRootUpdated` event implies that all rollup blocks below the
    mentioned block are confirmed, the current design of the process attempts to
    match every rollup block to a specific confirmation. This means that if there
    are two confirmations, and the earlier one points to block N while the later
    points to block M (such that M > N), the blocks from N+1 to M are linked with
    the latest confirmation, and blocks from X+1 to N are linked to the earlier
    confirmation (where X is the rollup block mentioned in an even earlier
    confirmation).

    Since the confirmations discovery process is asynchronous with respect to the
    block fetching process and the batches discovery process, there could be
    situations when the information about rollup blocks or their linkage with a
    batch is not available yet. Here is a list of possible scenarios and expected
    behavior:
    1. A rollup block required to proceed with the new confirmation discovery is
      not indexed yet, or the batch where this block is included is not indexed
      yet.
      - The new confirmation discovery process will proceed with discovering new
        confirmations and the L1 blocks range where the confirmation handling is
        aborted will be passed to the historical confirmations discovery process.
    2. A rollup block required to proceed with the historical confirmation discovery
      is not indexed yet, or the batch where this block is included is not indexed
      yet.
      - The historical confirmation discovery process will proceed with the same
        L1 blocks range where the confirmation handling is aborted until this
        confirmation is handled properly.

    As it is clear from the above, the historical confirmation discovery process
    could be interrupted by the new confirmation discovery process. As soon as the
    historical confirmation discovery process reaches the lower end of the L1 block
    range where the new confirmation discovery process is aborted, the historical
    confirmation discovery process will request the database to provide the next L1
    block range of missing confirmations. Such a range could be closed when there
    are end and start L1 blocks in which a missing confirmation is expected, or
    open-ended where the start block is not defined and the end block is the block
    preceding the L1 block where a confirmation was already handled by the discovery
    process.

  @non_ready_message "Skipping confirmations discovery since the unconfirmed blocks index is not ready yet"

  @doc """
    Discovers and processes new confirmations of rollup blocks within a calculated block range.

    This function identifies the appropriate L1 block range for discovering new
    rollup confirmations. In order to make sure that no confirmation is missed due
    to re-orgs, it adjusts the range to re-inspect some L1 blocks in the past.
    Therefore the lower bound of the L1 blocks range is identified based on the
    safe block or the block which is considered as safest if RPC does not support
    "safe" block retrieval.

    Before processing confirmations, the function checks if the unconfirmed blocks index
    is ready (when `check_for_readiness` is true). If the index is not ready, it returns
    a `:not_ready` status without performing the discovery.

    Then the function fetches logs representing `SendRootUpdated` events within
    the found range to identify the new tops of rollup block confirmations. The
    discovered confirmations are processed to update the status of rollup blocks
    and L2-to-L1 messages accordingly. Eventually, updated rollup blocks, cross-chain
    messages, and newly constructed lifecycle transactions are imported into the
    database.

    After processing the confirmations, the function updates the state to prepare
    for the next iteration. It adjusts the `new_confirmations_start_block` to the
    block number after the last processed block. If a confirmation is missed, the
    range for the next iteration of the historical confirmations discovery process
    is adjusted to re-inspect the range where the confirmation was not handled
    properly.

    ## Parameters
    - `state`: A map containing:
      - `config`: Configuration map with outbox address, RPC settings, and rollup first block
      - `task_data`: Task-related data including:
        - `new_confirmations`: Contains the `start_block` from which to begin the
          new confirmation discovery
        - `historical_confirmations`: Contains the `end_block` for historical confirmations
    - `check_for_readiness`: When true, checks if the unconfirmed blocks index is ready
      before proceeding with the discovery (defaults to true)

    ## Returns
    - `{:ok, new_state}`: If the discovery process completes successfully
    - `{:confirmation_missed, new_state}`: If a confirmation is missed and further
      action is needed
    - `{:not_ready, state}`: If the unconfirmed blocks index is not ready yet

  @doc """
    Selects an appropriate interval for task scheduling based on the confirmation status.

    When a confirmation is missed (:confirmation_missed), it indicates that required data
    is not yet available either in the database or in the parent chain. In this case,
    the :standard interval is used to allow more time for data accumulation.

    For successful confirmation (:ok), the :catchup interval is used since the required
    data is available and processing can proceed more rapidly.

    When the system is not ready (:not_ready), typically due to pending database migrations,
    it uses the configured DB migration check interval to periodically check readiness status.

    ## Parameters
    - `status`: The status returned by the confirmation worker (:ok, :confirmation_missed or :not_ready)
    - `intervals`: A map containing :standard and :catchup intervals

    ## Returns
    The selected interval duration in milliseconds.
