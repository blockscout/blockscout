defmodule Indexer.Fetcher.Arbitrum.Workers.Confirmations.RollupBlocks do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles the discovery and marking of confirmed rollup blocks in Arbitrum.

  In Arbitrum, a confirmation (via SendRootUpdated event) indicates that all rollup blocks
  up to a specific block number are confirmed. The module discovers which blocks belong to
  each confirmation by examining batches that contain these blocks. For example, if there
  are two confirmations where the earlier one points to block N and the later to block M
  (where M > N), the module links blocks from N+1 to M to the later confirmation. Starting
  from the batch containing the confirmed top block, it recursively examines previous
  batches until it either finds a batch with all blocks already confirmed or reaches the
  chain's initial block. Within each batch, it identifies unconfirmed blocks and ensures
  their continuity to prevent gaps in the confirmation sequence.

  The module handles batch-related confirmations by ensuring block continuity within each
  batch. If a block is not yet indexed or a batch association is missing, the confirmation
  processing is postponed. The module also verifies block continuity to detect and handle
  potential database inconsistencies, ensuring that no gaps exist in the confirmed blocks
  sequence.

    Discovers and marks all rollup blocks associated with provided confirmations.

    First, converts the input map of rollup block hashes to a map keyed by block numbers,
    transforming confirmation descriptions to use block numbers instead of hashes. Then
    processes these confirmations sequentially starting from the lowest rollup block
    number, ensuring that each block is associated with the correct confirmation. This
    sequential handling preserves the confirmation history, allowing future processing
    to accurately associate blocks with their respective confirmations.

    ## Parameters
    - `rollup_blocks_to_l1_transactions`: A map linking rollup block hashes (the "top" blocks
      in confirmations) to their confirmation descriptions
    - `outbox_config`: Configuration for the Arbitrum outbox contract
    - `rollup_first_block`: The block number limiting the lowest indexed block of
      the chain

    - A list of rollup blocks each associated with the transaction's hash that

  # Discovers rollup blocks within a single confirmation, ensuring no gaps in the confirmed range.
  #
  # This function follows these steps to identify unconfirmed rollup blocks related
  # to a single confirmation event:
  # 1. Retrieve the batch associated with the specified rollup block number.
  # 2. Obtain a list of unconfirmed blocks within that batch. For the historical
  #    confirmations discovery, the list will include both unconfirmed blocks that
  #    are covered by the current confirmation and those that a going to be covered
  #    by the predecessor confirmation.
  # 3. Determine the first unconfirmed block in the batch. It could be the first
  #    block in the batch or a block the next after the last confirmed block in the
  #    predecessor confirmation.
  # 4. Verify the continuity of the unconfirmed blocks to be covered by the current
  #    confirmation to ensure there are no database inconsistencies or unindexed
  #    blocks.
  # 5. If the first unconfirmed block is at the start of the batch, check if the
  #    confirmation also covers blocks from previous batches. If so, include their
  #    unconfirmed blocks in the range.
  # 6. If all blocks in the previous batch are confirmed or the current batch is
  #    the first batch in the chain intended to be indexed, return the current list
  #    of unconfirmed blocks.
  # 7. If the first unconfirmed block is in the middle of the batch, return the
  #    current list of unconfirmed blocks.
  # This process continues recursively until it finds a batch with all blocks
  # confirmed, encounters a gap, or reaches the start of the chain of blocks related
  # to the confirmation.
  #
  # Cache Behavior:
  # For each new confirmation, the cache for `eth_getLogs` requests starts empty.
  # During recursive calls for previous batches, the cache fills with results for
  # specific block ranges. With the confirmation description remaining constant
  # through these calls, the cache effectively reduces the number of requests by
  # reusing results for events related to previous batches within the same block
  # ranges. Although the same logs might be re-requested for other confirmations
  # within the same discovery iteration, the cache is not shared across different
  # confirmations and resets for each new confirmation. Extending cache usage
  # across different confirmations would require additional logic to match block
  # ranges and manage cache entries, significantly complicating cache handling.
  # Given the rarity of back-to-back confirmations in the same iteration of
  # discovery in a production environment, the added complexity of shared caching
  # is deemed excessive.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `rollup_block_num`: The rollup block number associated with the confirmation.
  # - `confirmation_desc`: Description of the latest confirmation.
  # - `outbox_config`: Configuration for the Arbitrum outbox contract.
  # - `rollup_first_block`: The block number limiting the lowest indexed block of
  #   the chain.
  # - `cache`: A cache to minimize repetitive `eth_getLogs` calls.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - `{:ok, unconfirmed_blocks}`: A list of rollup blocks that are confirmed by
  #   the current confirmation but not yet marked as confirmed in the database.
  # - `{:error, []}`: If a discrepancy or inconsistency is found during the

  # Checks if any blocks within a specific range are identified as the top of confirmed blocks by scanning `SendRootUpdated` events.
  #
  # This function fetches logs for `SendRootUpdated` events within the specified
  # L1 block range to determine if any rollup blocks within the given rollup block
  # range are mentioned in the events, indicating the top of confirmed blocks up
  # to that log. It uses caching to minimize `eth_getLogs` calls.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - A tuple `{rollup_start_block, rollup_end_block}` specifying the rollup block
  #   range to check for confirmations
  # - A tuple `{log_start, log_end}` specifying the L1 block range to fetch logs.
  # - `l1_outbox_config`: Configuration for the Arbitrum Outbox contract.
  # - `cache`: A cache of previously fetched logs to reduce `eth_getLogs` calls.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - A tuple `{:ok, latest_block_confirmed, new_cache, logs_length}`:
  #   - `latest_block_confirmed` is the highest rollup block number confirmed within
  #     the specified range.
  # - A tuple `{:ok, nil, new_cache, logs_length}` if no rollup blocks within the
  #   specified range are confirmed.
  # - A tuple `{:error, nil, new_cache, logs_length}` if during parsing logs a rollup
  #    block with given hash is not being found in the database.
  # For all three cases the `new_cache` contains the updated logs cache.
