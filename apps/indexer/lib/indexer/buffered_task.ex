defmodule Indexer.BufferedTask do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides a behaviour for batched task running with retries and memory-aware buffering.

  This module implements a generic buffered task system that allows for efficient
  processing of data in batches. It manages a queue of entries, processes them
  concurrently up to a specified limit, and provides mechanisms for retrying
  failed tasks. The module is designed to be memory-aware, with the ability to
  shrink its memory usage when requested by a memory monitor.

  The `BufferedTask` operates as follows:

  1. Initialization:
    When a module implementing the `BufferedTask` behaviour is started as part of
    a supervision tree, it must use `BufferedTask.child_spec/1` to define its
    child specification. This ensures that `BufferedTask.start_link/2` is called
    correctly, initializing the `BufferedTask` process with the implementing
    module's options. During this initialization, the periodic flushing of
    buffers to the processing queue is also set up, establishing an automated
    cycle of data processing.

  2. Initial Data Streaming:
    Upon initialization, the `BufferedTask` sends itself an `:initial_stream`
    message. This triggers a call to the `init/3` callback of the implementing
    module, populating the queue with initial data.

  3. Data Processing Flow:
    a. Data Entry:
        - External processes can add entries to the buffer using the `buffer/4`
          function. This function allows for both synchronous and asynchronous
          buffering of entries, with an option to prioritize entries.
    b. Flushing:
        - Periodically, based on the `flush_interval`, or when manually triggered,
          the buffered entries are moved to the main processing queue. This
          flushing process automatically triggers the processing of the next
          batch of queue data, ensuring continuous data handling without manual
          intervention.
    c. Batch Processing:
        - As concurrency becomes available (controlled by `max_concurrency`),
          batches of entries (size determined by `max_batch_size`) are taken from
          the queue and processed by spawning tasks that call the `run/2` callback
          of the implementing module.
    d. Retry Mechanism:
        - If a task fails or explicitly requests a retry, the entries are
          re-added to the queue for another processing attempt.

  The entire process of periodic flushing, batch processing, and retry handling
  is automated, requiring no manual management once the `BufferedTask` is
  initialized. This design ensures efficient and continuous data processing with
  minimal overhead.

  The `BufferedTask` is designed to be memory-aware and can interact with a
  memory monitor to adjust its memory usage when system resources are constrained.
  It also provides debugging capabilities to monitor its internal state and
  performance.

  ## Initialization Parameters

  The following parameters are passed to `BufferedTask.init/1` through
  `BufferedTask.child_spec/1` and `BufferedTask.start_link/2`:

  - `:callback_module`: Required. The module implementing the `BufferedTask`
    behaviour.
  - `:task_supervisor`: Required. The name of the `Task.Supervisor` to spawn
    tasks under.
  - `:flush_interval`: Required. The interval in milliseconds between automatic
    queue flushes. Set to `:infinity` to disable automatic flushing.
  - `:max_batch_size`: Required. The maximum number of entries to be processed
    in a single batch.
  - `:max_concurrency`: Required. The maximum number of concurrent processing
    tasks allowed.
  - `:memory_monitor`: Optional. The `Indexer.Memory.Monitor` server to register
    with for memory-aware operations.
  - `:poll`: Optional. Boolean flag to enable/disable polling for new data after
    processing all current entries. Defaults to `true`.
  - `:state`: Required. Initial state for the callback module. This can include
    any parameters or initial values required for proper functioning of `init`
    and `run` callbacks.
  - `:metadata`: Optional. Logger metadata to set in the `BufferedTask` process
    and its child processes.

  ## Callbacks

  ### `c:init/3`

  @callback init(initial, reducer, state) :: {final, state}

  This callback is invoked during the initial streaming process to populate the
  queue with initial data. It runs in a separate task, allowing for long-running
  operations without blocking the main `BufferedTask` process.

  - `initial`: An opaque value representing the initial accumulator. Its structure
    and content are fully controlled by the `reducer` function, so there's no need
    to handle this parameter specifically within the `init/3` callback.
  - `reducer`: A function that accumulates entries into the `BufferedTask`'s
    internal buffers.
  - `state`: The initial state provided during initialization.

  The `init/3` callback should use the `reducer` function to add entries to the
  `BufferedTask`'s buffers. The `BufferedTask` will automatically manage these
  entries, flushing them to the main processing queue and initiating batch
  processing as needed.

  ### `c:run/2`

  @callback run(entries, state) :: :ok | {:ok, state} | :retry | {:retry, new_entries :: list} | {:retry, new_entries :: list, state}

  This callback is invoked as concurrency becomes available to process batches
  of entries from the queue. It is called within a task spawned by the
  `Task.Supervisor` specified during initialization.

  - `entries`: A list of entries to be processed, with a maximum length of
    `:max_batch_size`.
  - `state`: The current state of the callback module.

  The `run/2` callback processes the given entries and returns one of the following
  possible results:

  - `:ok`: Indicates successful processing.
  - `{:ok, state}`: Indicates successful processing and requests an update to
    the callback module state.
  - `:retry`: Signals that the entire batch should be retried.
  - `{:retry, new_entries}`: Specifies a new list of entries to be retried. This
    can be a completely new list of entries or a subset of entries which were not
    successfully handled by `run/2` in this iteration.
  - `{:retry, new_entries, state}`: Specifies a new list of entries to be retried
    and requests an update to the callback module state.

  If the callback crashes, the `BufferedTask` will automatically retry the batch.
  The retry mechanism ensures resilience in data processing, allowing for
  temporary failures or resource unavailability to be handled gracefully.

  The `BufferedTask` manages concurrency, ensuring that no more than
  `:max_concurrency` `run/2` callbacks are executing simultaneously. This
  provides controlled parallelism while preventing system overload.

  ## Examples

  ### Typical Usage

  Here's a comprehensive example of a module implementing the BufferedTask behaviour
  for processing random integers:

      defmodule NumberProcessor do
        # Will generate the Supervisor and TaskSupervisor for NumberProcessor
        use Indexer.Fetcher, restart: :permanent

        alias Indexer.BufferedTask

        def child_spec([init_options, gen_server_options]) do
          state = %{initial_count: 50}

          buffered_task_init_options =
            [
              poll: false,
              flush_interval: 5000,
              max_batch_size: 10,
              max_concurrency: 2,
              task_supervisor: NumberProcessor.TaskSupervisor,
              metadata: [task: :number_processor]
            ]
            |> Keyword.merge(init_options)
            |> Keyword.put(:state, state)

          Supervisor.child_spec(
            {BufferedTask, [{__MODULE__, buffered_task_init_options}, gen_server_options]},
            id: __MODULE__
          )
        end

        @impl BufferedTask
        def init(initial, reducer, %{initial_count: count}) do
          Enum.reduce(1..count, initial, fn _, acc ->
            number = :rand.uniform(1000)
            reducer.(number, acc)
          end)
        end

        @impl BufferedTask
        def run(numbers, _state) do
          Enum.each(numbers, fn number ->
            result = if rem(number, 2) == 0, do: "even", else: "odd"
            IO.puts("Number \#{number} is \#{result}")
          end)
          :ok
        end

        def add_numbers(count, high_priority?) do
          numbers = Enum.map(1..count, fn _ -> :rand.uniform(1000) end)
          BufferedTask.buffer(__MODULE__, numbers, high_priority?)
        end
      end

  To use this module in your application's supervision tree:

      children = [
        {NumberProcessor.Supervisor, [[memory_monitor: memory_monitor]]}
      ]

      Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  This setup assumes you have a memory_monitor defined elsewhere in your application.

  To add more numbers to the buffer after initialization:

      NumberProcessor.add_numbers(20, false)  # Add 20 numbers with normal priority
      NumberProcessor.add_numbers(5, true)    # Add 5 numbers with high priority

  ### Minimal Init and Retry Example

  This example demonstrates two key features of BufferedTask: a minimal `init/3`
  callback that simply passes through the initial state and use of `{:retry, new_entries}`
  in the `run/2` callback for task rescheduling.

      defmodule TaskScheduler do
        use Indexer.Fetcher, restart: :permanent

        alias Indexer.BufferedTask

        def child_spec([init_options, gen_server_options]) do
          state = %{max_retries: 3}

          buffered_task_init_options =
            [
              poll: false,
              flush_interval: 1000,
              max_batch_size: 10,
              max_concurrency: 5,
              task_supervisor: TaskScheduler.TaskSupervisor,
              metadata: [fetcher: :task_scheduler]
            ]
            |> Keyword.merge(init_options)
            |> Keyword.put(:state, state)

          Supervisor.child_spec(
            {BufferedTask, [{__MODULE__, buffered_task_init_options}, gen_server_options]},
            id: __MODULE__
          )
        end

        @impl BufferedTask
        def init(initial, _reducer, _state) do
          initial
        end

        @impl BufferedTask
        def run(tasks, %{max_retries: max_retries} = state) do
          now = System.system_time(:millisecond)
          {due_tasks, future_tasks} = Enum.split_with(tasks, &(&1.at <= now))

          new_future_tasks = Enum.map(due_tasks, fn task ->
            case execute_task(task) do
              :ok -> nil
              :error ->
                retry_count = Map.get(task, :retry_count, 0)
                if retry_count < max_retries do
                  %{task | retry_count: retry_count + 1}
                end
            end
          end)
          |> Enum.reject(&is_nil/1)

          case future_tasks ++ new_future_tasks do
            [] -> :ok
            remaining_tasks -> {:retry, remaining_tasks}
          end
        end

        defp execute_task(%{fun: fun, args: args}) do
          try do
            apply(fun, args)
            :ok
          rescue
            _ -> :error
          end
        end

        def schedule_task(at, fun, args) do
          task = %{at: at, fun: fun, args: args}
          BufferedTask.buffer(__MODULE__, [task], false)
        end
      end

  To use this module in your application's supervision tree:

      children = [
        {TaskScheduler.Supervisor, [[memory_monitor: memory_monitor]]}
      ]

      Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  To schedule a new task:

      TaskScheduler.schedule_task(
        System.system_time(:millisecond) + 5000,
        fn -> IO.puts("Hello from the future!") end,
        []

  BufferedTask struct:
  * `init_task` - reference to the initial streaming task. This field holds the
    `Task.t()` for the initial data population process. It's used to track the
    completion of the initial data streaming.
  * `flush_timer` - reference to the timer for periodic buffer flushing. This
    field stores the timer reference returned by `Process.send_after/3`, which
    is scheduled using the `flush_interval`. When the timer triggers, it sends
    a `:flush` message to the process, initiating a buffer flush operation.
    This field is managed internally and doesn't need to be set by the user.
  * `callback_module` - module implementing the `BufferedTask` behaviour. This
    field must be set when initializing the `BufferedTask`. It specifies the
    module that defines the `init/3` and `run/2` callbacks, which are crucial
    for the operation of the buffered task.
  * `callback_module_state` - state maintained by the callback module. This
    field holds any state that the callback module needs to persist between
    calls to its callbacks. It's passed to and potentially updated by the
    `run/2` callback.
  * `task_supervisor` - name of the `Task.Supervisor` for spawning tasks. This
    field must be set during initialization. It's used to spawn concurrent
    tasks for processing batches of data, allowing for controlled
    concurrency.
  * `flush_interval` - interval in milliseconds between buffer flushes. This
    field must be set during initialization. It determines how often the
    buffer is automatically flushed, ensuring that data is processed even
    if the buffer doesn't fill up quickly. If set to `:infinity`, no automatic
    flushing occurs - it can be used for when manual flushing is preferred by
    sending a `:flush` message to the process.
  * `max_batch_size` - maximum number of entries in a batch for processing.
    This field must be set during initialization. It controls the size of
    batches sent to the `run/2` callback, allowing for optimized processing
    of data.
  * `max_concurrency` - maximum number of concurrent processing tasks. This
    field must be set during initialization. It limits the number of
    simultaneous `run/2` callback executions, preventing system overload.
  * `poll` - boolean flag to enable/disable polling for new records. This field
    has a default value of true. When true, the module will continue to call
    `init/3` to fetch new data after processing all current entries.
  * `metadata` - list of metadata for logging purposes. This field can be set
    during initialization. It's used to add context to log messages,
    improving the traceability of the buffered task's operations.
  * `current_buffer` - list of entries waiting to be processed. This field is
    used internally to store incoming entries before they're moved to the
    bound_queue for processing. Acts as a temporary holding area for
    incoming data.
  * `current_front_buffer` - list of high-priority entries for processing. These
    entries are moved to the front of the bound_queue during flushing.
  * `bound_queue` - queue with a maximum size limit for storing entries. This
    field uses a `BoundQueue` struct to efficiently manage entries while
    respecting memory constraints.
  * `task_ref_to_batch` - map of task references to their corresponding batches.
    This field is used internally to keep track of which batch is being
    processed by each spawned task, facilitating proper handling of task
    results and retries.

    `:initial_stream` message to self to start the initial streaming process,
    sets up the process as shrinkable if a memory monitor is provided, sets
    Logger metadata, and configures the initial state of `BufferedTask`
    including the state of a module implementing the BufferedTask behavior.

    ## Parameters
    - `{callback_module, opts}`: A tuple containing:
      - `callback_module`: The module implementing the BufferedTask behavior.

  #
  # The initialization process:
  # - Calls the `init/3` function of the callback module.
  # - Accumulates entries into chunks up to the maximum batch size.
  # - Pushes full chunks to the queue, triggering processing of queue data.
  # - Processes any remaining entries after initialization. These are entries that
  #   were accumulated but didn't form a complete chunk. They are pushed to the
  #   queue, ensuring no data is lost, and trigger processing of queue data (which
  #   may include these entries).
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `state`: The current state of the BufferedTask.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - Updated `state` with the new `init_task` reference and scheduled buffer flush.

  #
  # 1. When given the current state of the BufferedTask:
  #    - Takes a batch of entries based on the `max_batch_size`.
  #    - Returns the batch and an updated state.
  #
  # 2. When given a BoundQueue and `max_batch_size`:
  #    - Initializes the recursive batch-taking process.
  #    - Returns the batch and the updated BoundQueue.
  #
  # 3. Recursive implementation (private):
  #    - Recursively takes entries from the BoundQueue.
  #    - Accumulates entries until the requested number is reached or the queue is empty.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `state`: The current state of the BufferedTask.
  # - `bound_queue`: The BoundQueue to take entries from.
  # - `max_batch_size`: The maximum number of entries to take.
  # - `remaining`: The number of entries still to be taken (in recursive calls).
  # - `acc`: The accumulator for entries already taken (in recursive calls).
  #
  # ## Returns
  # Depending on the implementation:

  # 2. `{batch, updated_bound_queue}`
  # 3. `{reversed_batch, updated_bound_queue}`

  # Schedules the next operation based on the current state of the BufferedTask.

  #
  # This function has two clauses:
  # 1. When the queue is empty, there are no ongoing tasks, and polling is enabled,
  #    it re-initializes the stream to fetch more work.
  # 2. In all other cases, it schedules the next buffer flush.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `state`: The current state of the BufferedTask.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - Updated `state` after scheduling the next operation.

  #
  # ## Returns

  # a new task to process it. As soon as the task is spawned, the
  # `task_ref_to_batch` map is updated to enable retrying the task if needed.
  #
  # ## Parameters
  # - `state`: The current state of the BufferedTask.
  #
  # ## Returns
  # - An updated state if a new task was spawned. Otherwise, the original state
  #   is returned.

  @doc """
    Executes the run callback of the specified module.

    This function is designed to be called asynchronously by `Task.Supervisor`. It
    invokes the `run/2` callback of the specified callback module.

    ## Parameters
    - params: A map containing the following keys:
      - `:metadata`: Keyword list of logging metadata to be set.
      - `:callback_module`: The module that implements the `run/2` callback.
      - `:batch`: A list of items to be processed by the callback.
      - `:callback_module_state`: The current state of the callback module.

    ## Returns
    Returns the result of calling `run/2` on the callback module.

    ## Notes
    This function is public to allow it to be called by `Task.Supervisor`, but it's
    not intended for direct use outside of the BufferedTask context.
